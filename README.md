This is a place to keep all the notes, snippets, and other things that may be useful again one day.  The notes and scripts found here will vary widely, some _very_ raw, others relatively finished, some will be migrated elsewhere, some may be older copies, and some may just be _completely random_ and not even useful at all.

Visitor's Guide
---------------

- __[README.md](./README.md):__  ⇦ You are here.

- __[Notes](./Notes):__  Like it says: notes, documents, tutorials, thoughts, recipies, ...; some notable ones are:
    - __[000Notes](./Notes/000Notes.md):__  Active notes file, new stuff usually enters here and occasionally gets moved out into other files; newest stuff is near the top.

- __[Lab](./Lab):__  One-off tests, experiments, proofs-of-concept; island of misfit toys

- __[Scripts](./Scripts):__  Scripts that aren't just one-off tests

- __[Annex](./Annex):__  Additional materials saved from various sources; PDFs, images, archives

- __[Defunct](./_Defunct):__  Especially old stuff that probably isn't useful to anyone


### Making Your Own Pensieve

- Make your own with the [pensive template on GitHub](https://github.com/inventhouse/pensieve).
- This "visitor's guide" helps collaborators get oriented, if you choose to share your pensieve with anyone.
- [`git send`](https://github.com/inventhouse/bettergit#git-save) is _extremely_ helpful for making quick commits _quickly_; all of my [bettergit tools](https://github.com/inventhouse/bettergit) and [allgit](https://github.com/inventhouse/allgit) are also recommended.
